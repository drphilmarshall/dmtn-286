\section{Introduction}
As outlined in \citeds{DMTN-199} only the Rubin team have access to pixel data for an embargo period of 80 hours and thirty days during commissioning. We assume this also means PNG or other format images captured from screens etc which may show pixel data e.g. from RubinTV on the summit.


\section {Systems that need policies}
In various discussions the list of tools we need to have polices for are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Confluence
    \item Jira
    \item github (e.g., draft technotes, Construction paper drafts, notebooks with plots)
    \item technotes on lsst.io
    \item Slack
    \item summit tooling (i.e RubinTV)
    \item USDF tooling
    \item email lists
\end{enumerate}

We discuss each in a section below.

\subsection{Confluence}
Much of confluence is public (all of DM is public by choice).
SITCOM is restricted to login but not more than that.
The main area where one may expect to see images would be performance analysis - an admittedly  cursory glance at all attachments suggests there are not many.
There are many links to notebooks - this is fine as notebooks require execution/access.

\subsubsection{Proposed policy}
Do not up load any pixel images or parts of pixel images or screenshots of images to confluence.
Use an authenticated link to any image rather than the actual image if it is needed in a page.
